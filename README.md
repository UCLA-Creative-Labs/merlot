### Setup

We're using nvm to ensure everyone is on the same node version.

If you don't have nvm installed, install nvm with: `brew install nvm`. Follow instructions to place the needed commands in either your `.bash_profile` or `.zshrc` (or configs for whatever shell you are using).

Switch to our version of node with `nvm use`.

We are using npm as a package manager. Run `npm install` to pull in packages.

We are using gatsby, install their cli with: `npm install -g gatsby-cli`.
